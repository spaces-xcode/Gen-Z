Violent clashes have erupted between protesters and security forces in Morocco as youth-led demonstrations, organized by groups like GenZ 212, continued for a fourth day. Hundreds marched through the streets demanding better social services and less corruption.

## Demands of the Protesters:
*   Improved **health services**
*   Improved **education services**
*   Better **employment opportunities**
*   Criticism of money spent on building stadiums for the 2030 Fifa World Cup, with one sign stating: "At least the Fifa stadium will have a first aid kit! Our hospitals don't".

## Security Force Actions:
*   The Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH) has accused security forces of **physically assaulting protesters** and carrying out **arbitrary arrests**.
*   Reports indicate a protester in Oujda suffered injuries after being hit by a police car.
*   Approximately 200 protesters have been arrested, though most have since been released, with 37 on bail.
*   The government coalition praised the "balanced reaction of security authorities in line with relevant legal procedures," contrasting with AMDH's accusations.

## Nature of Protests:
*   Organized on social media by loosely formed youth groups like GenZ 212.
*   GenZ 212 urged participants to remain peaceful and avoid vandalism, expressing regret over acts of rioting or vandalism.
*   Protesters reportedly hurled stones at security forces, and local media reported cars and banks being set alight.

This uprising follows similar youth-led demonstrations in Nepal, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Madagascar.
